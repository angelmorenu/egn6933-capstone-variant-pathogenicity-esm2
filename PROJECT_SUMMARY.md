# Project Summary: ML-Driven Functional Genomics System

**Status:** ✅ Fully Planned & Ready for Execution  
**Date:** January 7, 2026

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Title:** An End-to-End Machine Learning System for Interpreting Non-Coding Genetic Variants Using Functional Genomics Data

**Type:** Individual Capstone Project  
**Course:** EGN 6933 - Project in Applied Data Science  
**Instructor:** Dr. Edwin Marte Zorrilla

---

## 🔬 The Problem

Most disease-associated genetic variants identified by GWAS lie in non-coding regulatory regions, but their functional impacts are difficult to interpret experimentally. This limits translation of genetic discoveries into clinical applications.

---

## 💡 Your Solution

Build an end-to-end ML system that:
1. Takes DNA sequence variants as input
2. Integrates functional genomics data (ENCODE, GTEx)
3. Predicts regulatory impact using deep learning
4. Provides interpretable scores with visual explanations
5. Delivers via CLI tool or web interface

---

## ✨ Why This Project is Excellent

✅ **ML-Heavy:** CNNs, Transformers, pretrained models, rigorous evaluation  
✅ **System Design:** Full pipeline from data → training → deployment  
✅ **Well-Scoped:** Public data, proven feasible, one-semester timeline  
✅ **Aligned Background:** Leverages your CAP5510, Applied ML, Ethics coursework  
✅ **Clear Deliverables:** Code + Models + Demo + Documentation  
✅ **Advisor Appeal:** You handle ML; they guide biology  
✅ **Career Value:** Excellent portfolio piece for PhD/industry  
✅ **Ethical & Impactful:** Public data, precision medicine application
